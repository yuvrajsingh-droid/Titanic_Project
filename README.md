# 🚢 Titanic Dataset Analysis & Survival Prediction

This project explores the famous **Titanic dataset** from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).  
It involves **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, data cleaning, visualization, and building **Machine Learning models** to predict passenger survival.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
- Perform **data cleaning** (handle missing values, encode categorical data).
- Conduct **EDA** with visualizations:
  - Survival rate by gender, age, class, and family size.
  - Correlation between features.
- Apply **feature engineering** (e.g., extracting titles from names, creating family size features).
- Build and evaluate **classification models** to predict survival.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
